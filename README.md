### I'm Mike Mackintosh!

# A Builder at Heart
We live in a time where humans have taught monkeys to speak, dogs to perform CPR and rocks to think for themselves. It takes some really crazy creativity and bravey to do that!

I love going against the grain to figure out how to solve problems when someone else says "it's not possible" or "it can't be done!" It's not about proving others wrong, it's about proving to myself that humans are the only thing limiting themselves.
